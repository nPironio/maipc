Maipc (Madmom applied in [the field of] pulse clarity) is a Python library developed to implement the pulse clarity metrics
presented in [1]_, based on the madmom [2]_ package.

It provides the implementation of all the metrics proposed to be used in python 
programs. It also comes with a script that enables the user to run any 
given metric for an audio file from the command line.   

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

To install the ``maipc`` package, you must have Python 3.6 or newer
installed, as well as the following packages:

- `madmom <https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom>`_
- `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
- `scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_
- `cython <http://www.cython.org>`_
- `mido <https://github.com/olemb/mido>`_
- `KDEpy <https://github.com/tommyod/KDEpy>`_
- `Python fire <https://github.com/google/python-fire>`_

Please refer to the `requirements.txt <requirements.txt>`_ file for the minimum
required versions and make sure that these modules are up to date.

Install from package
--------------------
The package can be installed via ``maipc`` from the `PyPI (Python Package Index)
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_::

	pip install maipc

Install from source
-------------------

If you plan to use the package as a developer, clone the Git repository::

    git clone  https://github.com/nPironio/maipc.git

Then you can simply install the package in development mode::

    python setup.py develop --user

Usage
=====

``maipc`` has three main modules:

* ``rnn.py``: provides the ``cell_state_precision``, ``neurons_cross_correlation`` and ``autocorrelation_periodicity`` pulse clarity metric functions.
* ``dbn.py``: provides the ``viterbi_max`` and ``viterbi_entropy`` pulse clarity metric functions.
* ``output.py``: provides the ``peak_average``, ``RNN_entropy`` and ``DBN_entropy`` pulse clarity metric functions.

Each metric is a function with signature ::

	def metric_function(audio_path, downbeat_model=True)

Where ``audio_path`` can be ei
ther a string representing an audio file path or a list of paths, and ``downbeat_model`` indicates wether to use the downbeat or beat tracking model implemented in [2]_.

Using the package in a Python script
------------------------------------

You can import each module separately ::

	import maipc.dbn as DBN

	DBN.viterbi_max('my_audio_file.wav')

Or simply import the whole package, which in turn imports the metric functions ::

	import maipc

	maipc.viterbi_max('my_audio_file.wav')


Using the CLI program
---------------------

Included in the ``bin/`` folder comes the ``maipc`` program, which enables to run any metric from a console interface ::

	$ maipc <metric_fn> 'my_audio_file.wav'

Or if you want the result for a list of files ::

	$ maipc viterbi_max '["audio1.wav", "audio2.wav", ... ]'
